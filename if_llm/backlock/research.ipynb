      "Dear stakeholders, \n",
      "The world has been confronted with extraordinary circumstances of various origins for the \n",
      "last three years – a pandemic, extreme weather events, a war in Europe, surging energy \n",
      "prices, broader inflation, disrupted supply chains, and interest rates rising at a speed not \n",
      "seen in decades. In such turbulent times, we can count ourselves among the lucky ones. \n",
      "Our business – investing in energy transition infrastructure – is proving resilient, and the \n",
      "underlying mission to mitigate climate change and helping to build clean, affordable, and \n",
      "secure energy systems has not been put in question.\n",
      "On the contrary, it has now become abundantly clear that decentralised, efficient, and \n",
      "flexible energy systems based on renewable sources also increase energy security and \n",
      "affordability for nations and consumers, thus driving economic activity and helping create \n",
      "prosperous societies. We have reason to be hopeful that the increasing awareness of this \n",
      "reality is going to provide a further boost to energy transition efforts across the globe.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the complexities associated with investing in the energy transition have \n",
      "certainly not decreased. How are rising interest rates going to affect capital allocation? \n",
      "How can we diversify and secure supply chains and how do we ensure human rights are \n",
      "respected along the entire supply chain? How can we mobilise more private capital into \n",
      "energy transitions, also in developing markets? How can we ensure that the urgent buildout \n",
      "of clean energy infrastructure is accomplished in partnership with local communities and \n",
      "without tarnishing relevant ecosystems? And how does all this contribute to creating value \n",
      "for investors and delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns?\n",
      "These challenges increasingly test managers’ abilities in areas beyond their traditional \n",
      "investment expertise – abilities that are based on experience and intricate sector \n",
      "knowledge. With our exclusive focus on energy transition infrastructure, and our 13-year \n",
      "track record in the sector, we feel very well-positioned to tackle these challenges.\n",
      "Accordingly, we expect of ourselves to be leaders in our sector’s efforts to deliver credible \n",
      "positive impact, avoid negative impacts, and report on those efforts to our stakeholders in a \n",
      "transparent manner. Fortifying a mindset that considers ESG factors at every turn has been \n",
      "a key focus for us over the last year, and it has been a pleasure to see these efforts reflected \n",
      "so well in the daily conduct of our entire team. We will continue to drive our efforts in those \n",
